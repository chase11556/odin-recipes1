    <h1>Eggs Over Easy</h1>
    <img src="eggs.jpg" alt="Eggs Over Easy">
    <p>A simple and very tasty recipe for eggs. This recipe is for over-easy eggs but you can cook longer and the yolk will set even more. The hardest part is flipping the eggs over.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
       <li>Melt butter in an 8-inch nonstick pan over medium heat. Once butter is melted, crack eggs into the pan. Tilt pan to evenly distribute eggs. Cook until whites are no longer translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip eggs by pushing the pan away from you and slightly tossing eggs up and over. Move pan upwards to catch eggs.</li> 
       <li>Cook on second side until desired doneness, 30 to 45 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
